The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

Status
------

DSLogic software is in a usable state and has had official tarball releases.

However, it is still work in progress. Some basic functionality
is available and working, but other things are still on the TODO list.
