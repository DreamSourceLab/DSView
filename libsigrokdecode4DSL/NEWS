0.3.0 (2014-05-06)

means it is NOT backwards-compatible and frontends will need updates.

 * New supported protocol decoders:
   - guess_bitrate  Guess the bitrate/baudrate of a signal
   - ir_nec         NEC infrared remote control protocol
   - ir_rc5         RC-5 infrared remote control protocol

   - z80            Zilog Z80 microprocessor disassembly
 * Add support for annotation rows, i.e. groups of annotation classes that
   are supposed to be displayed on the same GUI "row" together.
 * Add support for the new OUTPUT_BINARY feature, which allows PDs to output
   decoded data in various file formats (for loading and further processing
   in other tools, or for direct live piping into other tools).
 * Add support for the OUTPUT_META output type. This is used by PDs for
   reporting various data points to the frontends, allowing them to perform
   various post-processing and statistics tasks on them (e.g. simple counts,
   average/mean values, min/max values, and so on).
 * The OUTPUT_PROTO output type is now called OUTPUT_PYTHON.
 * All protocol decoders:
   - Bump the 'api_version' field of all decoders to 2. They are no longer
     compatible (and cannot be used with) older libsigrokdecode versions.
   - Updates to emit proper annotation classes, annotation sample numbers,
     and annotation rows for GUI usage (bugs #146, #148, #150, #151, #154,
     #155, #162, #147, #163, #168, #156, #309, and #344).

     can for example always show the longest annotation per zoom-level).
   - Extensive protocol information has been moved from the PDs to the wiki.
     Example: http://sigrok.org/wiki/Protocol_decoder:Uart
   - Use correct I²C / I²S names in user-visible texts (not I2C/I2S).

   - Fix corner case that can yield issues when using triggers on LAs.
   - Drop unneeded 'addressing' option.

   - Fix the handling of optional channels.
   - Make the RESET# pin optional.
 * onewire_link:
   - Split 'reset' and 'presence' annotations.
 * pan1321:

   - Various internal fixes and improvements.
 * parallel:
   - Fix internal use of the obsolete 'metadata' parameter (bug #202).

   - Emit bit-exact annotations for the register fields that need them.
   - Fix a Python issue with duplicate keys in a dict (bug #191).
 * spi:
   - Either MISO or MOSI can be optional now, but not both (bug #175).
   - The CS# pin is optional now. If the pin is supplied, it is honored
     (decoding only happens when the pin is asserted). Otherwise decoding will
     use every CLK edge, regardless of CS# state or CS# existence (bug #152).
   - Rename the 'SCK' pin to the more common 'CLK'.
   - Output bit-exact annotations and data for use by stacked PDs.
   - Fix a bug occurring when only MOSI (but not MISO) was supplied.
 * transitioncounter:
   - Drop the obsolete 'transitioncounter' dummy protocol decoder.
 * uart:
   - Fix corner case that can yield issues when using triggers on LAs.
   - Use 'T' for stop bits and 'P' for parity bits (shortest annotations).
   - Add a data format selection option.
   - Annotations for RX and TX are now emitted in different annotation rows.
   - Either the RX or TX signal can be optional now (but not both).

   - Add support for OUTPUT_BINARY output for RX, TX, or both.
   - Output bit-exact annotations and data for use by stacked PDs.

     in the 'uart' protocol decoder itself via OUTPUT_BINARY).
 * usb_packet:
   - The 'usb_protocol' decoder has been renamed to 'usb_packet'.
   - Various bugfixes and decoding improvements.
 * usb_signalling:
   - Fix decoding of individual bits, sample in the middle of bits (bug #158).
 * libsigrokdecode API changes overview:
   - Add srd_session_new(), srd_session_destroy(), and a session context.
   - Add srd_session_metadata_set().

     PDs now have a new optional metadata() method to receive it.
   - Output types are now registered via Decoder.register(), not Decoder.add().
   - The report() method is now obsolete. This kind of information will be
     passed to the frontends via the OUTPUT_META output type, allowing the
     frontends to perform various post-processing and statistics tasks.
   - PDs can now define BINARY_OUTPUT types via the 'binary' tuple.
   - PDs can now define annotation rows via the 'annotation_rows' tuple.
   - PD options are now a tuple of dicts. Each option is a dict containing
     the keys 'id', 'desc', 'def', and 'values'. Valid option types are
     UTF-8 strings, integers, and floats (bugs #254, #306, #317, #165).
   - Channels, optional channels, and annotations are now tuples (not lists).
   - Only load PDs of API version 2, all other versions are incompatible.
 * srd_inst_channel_set_all(): Report an error if not all channels required
   by the respective protocol decoder have been supplied.
 * Remove some internal limitations to max. 64 channels (bug #120).
 * Add a unit test suite framework for libsigrokdecode ('make check').
 * Add a protocol decoder test-suite framework for developers (tests/pdtest).
 * Various bugfixes:
   - srd_inst_option_set(): Properly return an error on exceptions.
   - srd_inst_option_set(): Fix setting of instance options, caused by class
     variable clobbering or releasing borrowed references (bugs #170, #174).
   - srd_decoder_load(): Error out upon invalid module names (bug #176).
   - srd_decoder_load(): Don't try to load an already loaded PD twice.

   - Fix issues with PDs not getting the samplerate (bugs #97, #132, #166).
   - Don't incorrectly decrease a borrowed reference (bug #177).
   - Fix various memory leaks and segfault conditions.
 * Build system:
    - Use pkg-config (not python3-config) to check for Python libs.
      This enables (better) libsigrokdecode cross-compile support.
    - PDs no longer have an extra Makefile.am, and 'make install' now
      happens via a Python script.
    - configure: Clearly mark required and optional libs.
    - Fix an issue with DESTDIR support (bug #215).
    - Add the HACKING file to the tarball.

   - Python >= 3.2 (required)
   - check >= 0.9.4 (optional, only needed for the libsigrokdecode testsuite)
   - libsigrok >= 0.3.0 (optional, only needed for the developer PD testsuite)

 * New 'make install'-time requirement:
   - Python >= 3.2 (required)
